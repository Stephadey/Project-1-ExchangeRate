#  Project 1 - Group 4

## Introduction

This project brings to life an analytical platform designed to deliver in-depth insights into the fluctuations of currency exchange rates, emphasising the analysis of currency strengths, historical patterns, and the repercussions of significant financial downturns on currency valuations. Tailored for those engaged in forex trading, economic studies, or seeking knowledge about financial markets, this tool offers the advantage of real-time data visualisation coupled with retrospective analyses.

The goal of this project is twofold: it not only provides a reliable resource for monitoring and dissecting currency exchange rates but also sheds light on the mechanisms governing the currency markets under both standard and crisis conditions. This multifaceted utility renders the tool indispensable to a diverse audience, including forex market participants, students of economics, and finance aficionados, thereby enriching their understanding and engagement with the financial world.

 **Analysis questions:**
 1. Impact Analysis on Exchange Rates:
	 - Objective: To assess how AUD was affected during a specific historical event, in this case, the 2008 financial crisis.
2. How did AUD exchange rates change perform in 2023?
	- Objective: To track the historical performance of major currency pair, AUD/USD, and understand how their exchange rates have evolved over a specific time frame, in this case January - December 2023.
3. What are the current strong and weak currencies relative to a base currency?:
	 - Objective: To determine which currencies are currently performing well (strong) or poorly (weak) when compared to a specific base currency (in this case, the Australian Dollar, AUD).

**Major Currencies in the Worst Performers:**

-   JPY, CHF and USD were the Major currencies in the top 5 worst performers, indicating challenges against 3 major currencies during 2008 period.

**Performance of the Australian Dollar in 2023:**

-   The Australian dollar faced a challenging year in 2023 when measured against the USD, which is among the world's top ten strongest currencies. By September 2023, it had reached a low point of 63.58 US cents, marking its lowest level in ten months, following a gradual decline in the preceding months.
-   The global landscape experienced ongoing crises throughout the year, significantly impacting the foreign exchange market. Consequently, the Australian dollar's descent was not unexpected. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) clarifies that Australia employs a floating exchange rate system, where the Australian dollar's value is determined by the interplay of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market.
-   On the domestic front, factors such as interest rates and inflation figures also play a pivotal role in shaping the Australian dollar's performance on the global currency stage. In comparison to the USD, which boasts even higher interest rates and inflation rates than Australia, the AUD has displayed a consistent decline, with sporadic upticks, over the course of the past year.
